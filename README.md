# Kivy application to detect Indian Cuisine names

Project stages:

- [x] Train a Tensorflow model using openly available Indian food dataset on kaggle.    
- [x] Convert Tensorflow model into a Tensorflowlite model.    
- [x] Build a Kivy camera app emulating Android camera to take pictures and predict food in those images using trained TFlite model.     
- [ ] Package kivy application into an apk.    
- [ ] Deploy Apk on Android and test it on Indian dishes.
